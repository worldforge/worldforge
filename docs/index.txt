Atlas-C++

Welcome to Atlas-C++, the C++ reference implementation of the Atlas protocol.

NOTE!:
Many current programs use older version of Atlas-C++:
Make fresh checkout to clean directory:
cvs -z3 checkout -r atlas-cpp-0_3_10 forge/libs/Atlas-C++


This library implements the Atlas protocol, for use in client-server
game applications.  This library is suitable for linking to either
clients or servers.

VERSION

This is Atlas-C++ 0.5.x, the latest development version of Atlas-C++. The
0.4.x branch will contain NO API CHANGES. The 0.5.x branch is completely
experimental and may not be easy to track. Any changes affecting the API
should go into 0.5.x, as should any features which are not completely
stable. 0.6.0 will be the next stable branch.

You need at least gcc 2.95.2, here is URL for RPMS:

* Any versions of gcc older than 2.95.2 are not supported! *

In order to generate the documentation, you will need doxygen.

This release should compile and work with:
 - gcc 2.95.2
 - gcc 2.95.3test2 and up
 - "gcc 2.96" from Red Hat 7 (make sure you have the latest update -
   packages aending in "-69" and above should work)
 - gcc 3.0 (this was not out at the time of release, but CVS gcc worked)

SOCKET LIBRARIES

Atlas-C++ relies on iostreams being used as socket streams for network
communications. This means you will need to either use an existing library
or use your own.

One such a library is libsocket++, which you can download at:

ftp://ftp.umsicht.fhg.de/pub/unix/language/C++/class-libraries/socket++-1.10.tar.gz

For a version that compiles in recent Linux versions:

http://3.141593.org/source/socket++-1.10-wf1.tar.gz

If you are using FreeBSD, please use the version in /usr/ports/net/.

We have not had the chance to test this in windows yet.

DOCUMENTATION

To generate the documentation, simply configure the tree, then in Atlas-C++/
type "make docs". This will use doxygen to generate the documentation, which
will then reside in Atlas-C++/doc/.

Please read the file HACKING carefully before working on Atlas-C++.
