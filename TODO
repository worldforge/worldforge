Re-write operators so that for a given operator O, operatorO is implemented
using operatorO= rather than the other way around which is inefficient.

Add throw(ColinearVectors) to the appropriate vector and matrix
	rotation functions
Get rid of templates as template args, use ValueType for standard
	containers instead

Intersect functions unimplemented for dim != 2,3 (extremely low priority):
	Intersect(Polygon<>, AxisBox<>, bool)
	Intersect(Polygon<>, RotBox<>, bool)
	Intersect(RotBox<>, AxisBox<>, bool)
	Intersect(RotBox<>, RotBox<>, bool)
    These will be postponed until I can think of a way to write them,
    or someone needs them, whichever comes first
Add shape tests from COAL
Write rotateInverse() functions
Look into whether miniball code can handle using float instead of double;
	if so, replace Wrapped_array with Point
Requests from Jesse: NAN, INFINITY, RADIANS_TO_DEGREES, DEGREES_TO_RADIANS
Write an API reference for the library. Find some inline documentation tool?
Deal with difficulties in making certain functions friends of the
	appropriate classes
Rearrange the functions in foo_funcs.h to match the order in the class
	in foo.h

Schedule:
0.3.0 will come out once I get around to testing the Polygon intersect functions
      and make sure they work. At that point the old Intersect()/IntersectProper()
      interface will be removed, as will support for deprecated network
      formats in atlas_conv.h. This is also an appropriate time to make changes
      that break binary compatibility.
