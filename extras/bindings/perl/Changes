Revision history for Perl extension WorldForge::Eris.

      Wednesday, November 27 2002
	- Integrated into main Eris tree

      Monday, November 25 2002
	- Added Factory class, modified Entity typeinfo so it would work,
	  at this point the 'public API' of Eris is fully wrapped, though
	  the wrapper code is almost completely untested

      Friday, November 22 2002
	- Added Avatar, World, Entity, Log, TypeInfo classes
	- Added new classes, plus Meta and Timeout, to MANIFEST

      Wednesday, July 17 2002
	- Added the Connection, Room, Lobby, and Player
		modules to the MANIFEST, instead
		of having each module buildable on
		its own. This allows them to share
		header files.
	- Modified the Makefile.PL to use the
		new SigCPerl automatic conversion
		code generation, cleaned old by-hand
		conversion code out of the .xs files

      Thursday, July 4 2002
	- put this in WorldForge namespace

      Sunday, June 16 2002
	- restarted work on this, now that SigCPerl is working

0.01  Thu Apr 25 12:50:30 2002
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-X -n Eris
